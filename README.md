## Pure UI makers :arrow_double_up:

Pure UI maker, or "Pure UI developers," can use this documentation to learn how to build Pure UI from source. You will need Node >= 14.17 to build and run the project locally.

**You don't need to do any of this to use Pure UI!** This page is for people who want to contribute to the project, tinker with the source, or create a custom build of Pure UI.

If that's not what you're trying to do, the [documentation website](https://pureui.xyz) is where you want to be.

### What are you using to build Pure UI?

Components are built with [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/), a custom elements base class that provides an intuitive API and reactive data binding. The build is a custom script with bundling powered by [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).
